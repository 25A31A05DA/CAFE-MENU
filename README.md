# CAFE-MENU

This is a simple café menu webpage I built as part of the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) curriculum.  
It’s a fun project that uses basic HTML and CSS to create a styled menu page with coffee and dessert items.
